# Minecraft in python

For a walkthrough of the development, and code explanation check out the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHSRaVeQxIk&feature=youtu.be). This is meant to be a ursina demo, not a full game.



**Currently ursina does not support MacOS, and so this can't be run on MacOS computers**



## Setup

You will need to have python installed, along with pip for python. 



To get setup run:

1. `pip install ursina` or `sudo pip3 install ursina`
2. Run `python UrsaCraft_video.py` or `python3 UrsaCraft_video.py` to start the game
